- [✔︎] Add admin seed function that will create users and posts. It should be able to accept a series of posts that I've gotten from ChatGPT.
- [✔︎] Everything should be public. The auth control could really just be an extension of the partial view that is displayed when a user is logged in (or not). For example, the login form could be displayed in a modal that overlays the current page. And the avatar should be a sign in button if not authenticated.
- [✔︎] Show truncated posts on the home page.
- [ ] Get durable cache working for post detail and profiles.
- [✔︎] Better default avatar images for seeded content (or generate them)
- [✔︎] Add avatar to new post form so we know who's posting
- [✔︎] Add pagination for the list of posts on the index. (Will need to consider how to do this dynamically for an unknown number of pages.)
- [ ] Is there a file limit on uploads?

### Styles to clean up

- [ ] favicon
- [ ] feedback
- [ ] post form
- [ ] sign in button
- [ ] auth form buttons
