- [✔︎] Add admin seed function that will create users and posts. It should be able to accept a series of posts that I've gotten from ChatGPT.
- [ ] Everything should be public. The auth control could really just be an extension of the partial view that is displayed when a user is logged in (or not).
- [ ] Show truncated posts on the home page.
- [ ] Get durable cache working for post detail and profiles.
- [ ] Better default avatar images for seeded content (or generate them)

### Styles to clean up

- [ ] favicon
- [ ] feedback
- [ ] post form
- [ ] sign in button
- [ ] auth form buttons
